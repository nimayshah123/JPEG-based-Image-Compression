# JPEG Image Compressor

This repository contains the implementation of a JPEG-based image compression algorithm as part of the CS:663 (Digital Image Processing) course under Prof. Ajit Rajwade at IIT-B in the Autumn Semester of 2024.

### Authors:
- **Nimay Shah**
- **Kushal Jain**
- **Siddhartha Rajeev**

### Overview:
The project implements the grayscale JPEG compression algorithm, including key techniques such as:
- Block Formation
- Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
- Quantization
- Zig-Zag Scanning and Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
- Huffman Encoding

### Contents:
- **JPEG Compression Algorithm Implementation**: Code for compressing grayscale images using JPEG.
- **Performance Analysis**: Evaluation of RMSE and Bits Per Pixel (BPP) for different quality factors, included as a part of the report
- **Report**: Detailed documentation on the algorithm, its implementation, and results.

For detailed implementation and results, please refer to the full report included in the repository.
